    match: 'Liverpool vs Manchester City',
    league: 'Premier League',
    betType: 'Over 2.5 Goals',
    odds: 1.85,
    confidence: 0.82,
    value: 1.68,
    aiAnalysis: 'High probability of goals based on recent form and head-to-head history',
    reasoning: `Based on recent form, Liverpool enters this match with a strong home advantage, having won 4 of their last 5 games at Anfield. Their attacking trio has been effective, averaging 2.1 goals per match, and Mohamed Salah appears to be in top shape.

Manchester City, on the other hand, has shown some inconsistency on the road, especially when facing high-press teams. While their overall possession stats remain high (averaging 62% per game), they have conceded early goals in 3 of their last 4 away fixtures.

From a tactical standpoint, Klopp is expected to press high and target City's flanks, especially exploiting the right side where City has allowed 40% of their xG conceded. Haaland remains a threat, but his touches in the box have decreased by 18% over the last three matches due to tighter marking.

Weather conditions at Anfield are mild with no expected rain, which typically benefits Liverpool's faster playstyle. Referee assignments suggest a higher likelihood of cards, which could influence momentum in the second half.

Overall, the expected goals (xG) model favors Liverpool slightly at 1.65 to 1.38, suggesting a tight contest but with a slight edge for the home side. This match is likely to produce goals, with Over 2.5 being statistically supported in 7 of the last 8 head-to-head matchups.

Value may lie in markets like "Both Teams to Score" and "Liverpool Win or Draw," especially considering current bookmaker odds undervalue the home advantage.`,

    aiAnalysis: 'Le Classique historically produces high-scoring matches',
    reasoning: `Le Classique analysis indicates a high probability of goals based on both teams' recent attacking output and historical head-to-head data. PSG's front three have contributed to 15 goals in their last 5 home games.

Marseille's pressing style typically leads to transition opportunities, with their matches averaging 3.2 goals this season. The expected goals (xG) model suggests a combined 3.8 xG for this fixture.

Tottenham's high defensive line has been exploited in recent away games, conceding an average of 1.8 goals. Arsenal's quick transitions and wide attacking play matches up well against this vulnerability.

Expected goals (xG) model predicts Arsenal 2.4 - Tottenham 1.2, with Arsenal's home advantage and current form supporting the prediction. Historical derby data shows 76% of recent meetings producing over 2.5 goals.`,
